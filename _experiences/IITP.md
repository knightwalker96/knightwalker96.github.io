Developed a deep learning model for ‘Multimodal Complaint Identification’ for the newly curated multimodal dataset named Complaint, Emotion, and Sentiment Annotated Multi-modal Amazon Reviews Dataset (CESAMARD). In achieving this task, I had done data crawling, annotation, preprocessing, and developed an attention-based multi-modal, adversarial multi-task deep neuralnetwork model, as well as built relevant baseline models.
