Hi! I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. My academic and professional journey is driven by a passion for advancing AI through rigorous research and practical applications.

Currently, I am exploring the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), aiming to contribute impactful solutions to complex problems in AI. My research goals include developing a deep theoretical understanding of these domains and adhering to best practices to produce high-quality, innovative research outcomes.

Background: I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from NIT Durgapur (2022). Prior to my Master's, I gained some valuable industry experience as a software engineer at Samsung and Publicis Sapient.

By the way, when I'm not diving into AI research, you’ll likely find me smashing topspins in table tennis or strumming soulful tunes on my Hawaiian guitar—a perfect balance to my analytical pursuits!

Feel free to explore my projects, CV, or connect with me on LinkedIn to discuss AI, research, or shared interests.
