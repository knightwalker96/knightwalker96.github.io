title: "Sailboat Gridworld Trajectory Analysis using Hidden Markov Models"
collection: portfolio
permalink: /portfolio/project-1
excerpt: "This project focuses on analyzing trajectories using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) through three core components: Likelihood Calculation, Decoding, and Learning. The Likelihood component calculates the probability (likelihood) of an observed sequence given the current HMM parameters. This is fundamental for understanding how well the HMM explains the observed data. The Decoding component uses the Viterbi algorithm to determine the most likely sequence of hidden states for a given observed trajectory. This helps to map observed data to inferred underlying states, giving insight into the structure of the trajectory. The Learning component involves training the HMM parameters using the Baum-Welch algorithm, which iteratively adjusts the transition and emission probabilities to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This is essential for creating a more accurate HMM."
