collection: portfolio
permalink: /portfolio/project-2
excerpt: "This project explores foundational and modern reinforcement learning techniques through a systematic and practical approach. It implements key algorithms such as Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, SARSA, Q-Learning, and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), showcasing their capabilities in solving decision-making tasks across different environments. The project delves into dynamic programming methods to compute optimal policies, temporal-difference learning for effective policy optimization, and deep reinforcement learning techniques to handle high-dimensional and complex state spaces. Through these implementations, the project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of both classical and deep learning-based reinforcement learning paradigms. Key features include detailed visualizations, such as learning curves and convergence behaviors, which provide valuable insights into the performance and effectiveness of these algorithms."
